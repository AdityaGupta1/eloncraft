Who says you can't build a colony on Mars, or dig a tunnel across a city, or ride in fully electric, self-driving cars? Certainly not this mod. By bringing the magic of Elon Muskâ„¢ to Minecraft, Eloncraft lets you fulfill your wildest dreams of becoming a hat merchant or sending cars into space. 

Planned features include items from three of Elon Musk's companies: SpaceX, Tesla, and The Boring Company. Currently, development is focused on SpaceX.
