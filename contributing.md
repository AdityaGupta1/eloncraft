# Contributing

Contributing is driven by [issues](https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/eloncraft/issues). Issues that have been labeled ["good first issue"](https://github.com/AdityaGupta1/eloncraft/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are great ways to start contributing to this project.	

All contributions are submitted in the form of pull requests, which are reviewed by the repository owner. If your pull request closes an issue, write something like "closes #42" so that the issue is properly referenced. See [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) for more information.

If you see an issue that interests you, leave a comment asking to work on it and you will be assigned to that issue. If you have a change of heart and do not want to work on it anymore, leave another comment so it can be assigned to someone else.
